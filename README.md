# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to web scrape different sites to retrieve pieces of data (images, headlines, and facts) on Mars and display this data on one web-page. 

### Deliverable 1
We added to our original Mission to Mars code to retrieve some images and titles of the different Mars hemispheres.

### Deliverable 2 
Once we ensured our code worked and was pulling the title and image url for each hemisphere we added it to our scraping.py file and updated it to create a new function. To make sure this working correctly we checked our Mongodb database to see that the hemisphere data was being retrieved. Then, we updated our html code so that the hemisphere images and titles displayed on our webpage along with the rest of the info we retrieved.

### Deliverable 3 
Now, the "make it pretty" step. We updated our html code further and tested it to ensure someone accessing our webpage from an iphone could see the info just as well as a desktop user. Additionally, we updated our "scape new data" button to be green to stand out and we updated the header of the page have an orange "Mars" colored background.
